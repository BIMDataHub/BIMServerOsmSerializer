# OSMSerializer

This OSMserializer plugin provides a utility in BIMserver to download a BIM project as an OpenStudio model in .osm format.

Currently, it supports BIMserver 1.3.4. You can simply drag the OSMserializer.jar file into the BIMserver/plugin folder to use it.

An import IFC GUI interface will also be provided in the next release of OpenStudio.

Currently, we support the following IFC elements:
  1. IFCSpace
  2. IFCWall
  3. IFCSlab (ceilings and floors)
  4. IFCWindow
  5. IFCDoor

More building elements such roofs and curtain walls are currently underdevelopment.
